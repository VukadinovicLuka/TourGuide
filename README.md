# Tourist Guide Platform

**Tourist Guide Platform** is a comprehensive web application developed as part of the "Web Programming" course. The project focuses on creating an online tourism platform that enables users to explore and discover destinations worldwide. The system consists of two main components: a Content Management System (CMS) for administrators and content editors, and a public platform for reading tourist articles.

## üìã Project Overview

The **Tourist Guide Platform** provides a complete solution for managing and consuming tourist content. The CMS allows authenticated users to manage destinations, articles, and users with role-based access control, while the public platform offers visitors an intuitive interface to browse articles, discover destinations, and engage with content through comments.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Content Management System (CMS):
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure login system with role-based access (Content Editor vs Administrator)
- **Destination Management**: Create, edit, and manage tourist destinations with descriptions
- **Article Management**: Full CRUD operations for tourist articles with activity tagging
- **User Management**: Administrator functionality to manage system users and their permissions
- **Activity-based Organization**: Categorize articles by tourist activities (skiing, hiking, swimming, etc.)

### Public Reading Platform:
- **Article Discovery**: Browse latest articles, most popular content, and destination-specific content
- **Interactive Features**: Comment system for reader engagement
- **Smart Navigation**: Filter articles by destinations and tourist activities
- **Analytics**: Track article views and display trending content
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized viewing experience across devices

### Additional Features:
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and error handling
- **Pagination**: Efficient content browsing with paginated results
- **Security**: Password hashing and secure session management
- **Relational Database**: Persistent data storage with proper entity relationships

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
